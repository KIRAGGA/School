</header>

<p>Taibah follows a diverse approach to curriculum with the Telangana
  State Board of Secondary Education (SSC). The scheme of continuous and
   comprehensive evaluation (CCE) helps in improving studentâ€™s performance by 
   identifying his/her learning difficulties at regular time intervals. At Taibah 
   suitable remedial measures are taken for enhancing students learning performance. 
   The scheme of continuous and comprehensive evaluation has inbuilt flexibility for 
 schools to plan their own academic schedules as per specified guidelines on CCE.</p>

 <p>An orientation is given to students to familiarize them with emerging technologies 
   and relevant issues. Computers, Internet, spoken English, deeniyath, moral education and Sunnah 
   (teachings of Prophet (S.A.W.S) ) are integrated into the curriculum.
   Community-based activities form part of school learning, to build qualities
   of citizenship, compassion and empathy.
